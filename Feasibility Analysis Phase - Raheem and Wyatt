Feasibility Analysis: After you gather all the requirements, it is time for a feasibility analysis of the project.
You need to analyze all four different types of feasibility as shown below. 
Assume the following to facilitate the process of feasibility analysis
Assume the use of Node.js and MongoDB is a requirement from the customer. 

You also learned that the project needs to be finished in 10 days. 

1)	For technical feasibility, write a small paragraph explaining your current knowledge of Node. JS/MongoDB. 
What are all the challenges/solutions are you suspecting?
Ans: (Be done in the context of project login requirements)For the technical feasibility analysis of a project requiring Node.js and MongoDB 
to be completed in 10 days, it’s crucial to acknowledge the strengths and potential challenges of these technologies. Node.js facilitates 
efficient server-side scripting with JavaScript, enabling rapid development cycles, particularly for I/O-heavy operations. MongoDB offers a 
flexible, schema-less database structure, ideal for projects with evolving data models. However, challenges may arise from the project’s tight 
timeline, such as the need for rapid schema design and optimization for MongoDB and ensuring non-blocking asynchronous code in Node.js to maintain 
performance. Solutions include leveraging frameworks like Express.js for Node.js to streamline backend development and employing Mongoose for 
MongoDB to enforce schema validation, which can mitigate risks associated with data inconsistency. Additionally, implementing agile development
practices can help prioritize essential features, ensuring the project meets its 10-day deadline without compromising on quality.

2)	For schedule feasibility, again write a small paragraph explaining your ideas. Is it possible to be productive by learning? 
If you think it is not possible, can you finish it by hiring another extra developer with prior knowledge of these technologies?
Ans: (Be done in the context of project login requirements)Considering the stringent 10-day deadline and the project’s reliance on Node.js and 
MongoDB, assessing schedule feasibility hinges on the team’s current proficiency with these technologies. If the team lacks in-depth experience, 
the learning curve could severely hinder timely completion, making self-learning impractical within this tight timeframe. Therefore, hiring an 
additional developer with expertise in Node.js and MongoDB emerges as a strategic move to ensure the project’s on-schedule delivery. 
An experienced developer can directly address the project’s specific requirements, such as implementing secure login features, thereby 
significantly reducing development time and increasing the likelihood of meeting the deadline. This approach not only bolsters the project’s 
technical foundation but also allocates existing resources more effectively, ensuring that the project adheres to its schedule without 
compromising on quality or functionality.

3)	For operational feasibility, write another short paragraph explaining whether you need training on all these topics. 
Explain with the lowest cost Node.js training whatever you get in Udemy. 
Ans: (Be done in the context of project login requirements)Given the project’s tight timeline and specific requirements for Node.js and MongoDB,
operational feasibility hinges on the team’s ability to quickly adapt and implement these technologies. Considering the low cost and accessibility 
of Node.js training available on Udemy, it’s feasible to upskill the team rapidly if gaps in knowledge exist. However, the most cost-effective 
approach to ensure project delivery within 10 days while addressing operational challenges, such as implementing secure login features, would be 
to prioritize hiring or leveraging existing team members with the requisite expertise. This strategy minimizes the need for extensive training, 
thus ensuring operational efficiency and project success within the given constraints.


4)	For economic feasibility, assume the following: (Good Check by Professor)
a.	The customer wants to spend no more than $30K USD.
b.	You have 2 members in a group each of them needs to be paid at a rate of an average Node.js developer's salary 
($113K per year as shown in Google). You need to calculate the developer cost for 10 days.
Ans: The cost for 2 Node.js developers for 10 days with an average annual salary of 113K is approximately $6,200. 
c.	You have two different options for hardware. 
i.	One is an AWS EC2 Linux instance with 4cores and 16GB memory where you need to pay a standard rate 
(Check here for rates: https://calculator.aws/). 
ii.	The other option is an Inhouse server of similar configuration (assume that costs $2000) and needs 
an additional system admin whose average salary is $60k per year as shown in Google. 
iii.	Calculate the total cost of ownership for 1 year for both the options and you need to select the lower-cost option
for feasibility analysis. 
d.	If the total cost is below the amount the customer is giving then, it is economically feasible. Otherwise not. 
e.	**Remember, if you decide to hire an additional developer (to meet the schedule) you have to add that cost also 
(assume that the developer will also get the payment at the same rate of $113K per year). Also, remember to add the training cost.
Ans: The cost for two Node.js developers for a total of ten days is around $6,200. This estimate is calculated assuming 
the developers have an average annual salary of $113k. Additionally, if you choose to run an AWS EC2 Linux instance with 
4 cores and 16GB memory, the approximate annual cost is $1,600, assuming 24/7 operation. Conversely,
if you opt for an in-house server with comparable specifications, the total annual cost, including a $2,000 server cost, 
and a system administrator with a $60,000 annual salary, would be $62,000. Comparing the two hosting options, 
the AWS EC2 instance is significantly more cost-effective. If you add the developer cost to the lower hosting cost (AWS EC2),
the total cost comes to approximately $7,800. This is well below the customer's budget of $30,000, making the project 
economically feasible under these assumptions.
