Feasibility Analysis: After you gather all the requirements now it is the time for feasibility analysis for the project.
You need to analyze all the four different types of feasibility as shown below. 
Assume the following to facilitate the process of feasibility analysis
Assume use of Node.js and MongoDB is a requirement from the customer. 

You also learned that the project needs to be finished in 10days. 

1)	For technical feasibility, write a small paragraph explaining your current knowledge on Node.JS/MongoDB. 
What are all the challenges/solutions are you suspecting?
Ans: Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime that is known for its ability to handle asynchronous operations with a non-blocking I/O model. 
It is ideal for building scalable server-side applications. When paired with MongoDB, a NoSQL database that is flexible in handling large 
volumes of unstructured data with a schema-less design, it can be used to create robust applications. However, using Node.js and MongoDB 
together can be challenging. Some of the challenges include designing efficient data structures in MongoDB's flexible schema, mastering 
asynchronous programming in Node.js, and ensuring scalability and security in the application. These challenges can be addressed by using 
effective data modeling in MongoDB, which can be achieved using tools like Mongoose for schema definition. It is also important to embrace
modern JavaScript features like async/await to simplify asynchronous code in Node.js and to consider a microservices architecture for 
scalability. Additionally, adhering to security best practices such as regular updates, secure database connections, and robust input
validation is crucial to ensure application integrity.

2)	For schedule feasibility, again write a small paragraph explaining your ideas. Is it possible to be productive by learning? 
If you think it is not possible, can you finish it by hiring another extra developer with prior knowledge of these technologies?
Ans: When it comes to schedule feasibility, the success of a project that uses Node.js and MongoDB technology greatly depends on 
the proficiency level of the team handling these technologies. While learning on the job can be productive, it might slow down 
the initial progress of the project as the team members climb the learning curve. This delay could be critical, especially when 
the project timeline is tight. In such situations, it is advisable to hire an additional developer who has prior experience in 
Node.js and MongoDB. An experienced developer can not only speed up development but also mentor other team members, 
thereby enhancing the overall skill level of the team. This approach can effectively balance the need for immediate progress 
with the long-term benefits of upskilling the team, ensuring both immediate and future project success.

3)	For operational feasibility, write another short paragraph explaining whether you need training on all these topics. 
Explain with the lowest cost Node.js training whatever you get in Udemy. 
Ans: For operational feasibility, training is required depending on the current skill level of the team regarding Node.js and MongoDB. 
If the team is relatively inexperienced with these technologies, training could be highly beneficial. It ensures that team members have
a solid foundation and common understanding, which is crucial for the efficient development and maintenance of the project. 
Udemy is an excellent resource for cost-effective training. It offers a wide range of courses on Node.js, often at a low cost,
especially during sales or with coupons. These courses typically cover fundamental concepts and practical applications, 
and sometimes even integrate MongoDB, providing a comprehensive learning experience. By investing in such affordable training, 
the team can rapidly acquire the necessary skills, improving the projectâ€™s operational feasibility without incurring significant costs.

4)	For economic feasibility, assume the following: 
a.	The customer would like to spend no more than $30K USD.
b.	You have 2 members in a group each of them needs to be paid at a rate of an average Node.js developer salary 
($113K per year as shown in Google). You need to calculate the developer cost for 10 days.
Ans: The cost for 2 Node.js developers for 10 days with an average annual salary of 113K is approximately $6,200. 
c.	You have two different options for hardware. 
i.	One is an AWS EC2 Linux instance with 4cores and 16GB memory where you need to pay a standard rate 
(Check here for rates: https://calculator.aws/). 
ii.	The other option is an Inhouse server of similar configuration (assume that costs $2000) and needs 
an additional system admin whose average salary is $60k per year as shown in Google. 
iii.	Calculate the total cost of ownership for 1 year for both the options and you need to select the lower-cost option
for feasibility analysis. 
d.	If the total cost is below the amount the customer is giving then, it is economically feasible. Otherwise not. 
e.	**Remember, if you decide to hire an additional developer (to meet the schedule) you have to add that cost also 
(assume that the developer will also get the payment at the same rate of $113K per year). Also, remember to add the training cost.
Ans: The cost for two Node.js developers for a total of ten days is around $6,200. This estimate is calculated assuming 
the developers have an average annual salary of $113k. Additionally, if you choose to run an AWS EC2 Linux instance with 
4 cores and 16GB memory, the approximate annual cost is $1,600, assuming 24/7 operation. Conversely,
if you opt for an in-house server with comparable specifications, the total annual cost, including a $2,000 server cost, 
and a system administrator with a $60,000 annual salary, would be $62,000. Comparing the two hosting options, 
the AWS EC2 instance is significantly more cost-effective. If you add the developer cost to the lower hosting cost (AWS EC2),
the total cost comes to approximately $7,800. This is well below the customer's budget of $30,000, making the project 
economically feasible under these assumptions.
